            modelAnswer: "(a) IV: L/cm; DV: T/s; CV: mass of bob, angle (<10\u{00B0}), same location.\n(b) Time 20 oscillations; T = t\u2082\u2080/20; repeat and average.\n(c) L = 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0, 50.0, 60.0 cm.\n(d) L/cm | t\u2082\u2080(1)/s | t\u2082\u2080(2)/s | t\u2090\u1D65\u2091/s | T/s | T\u00B2/s\u00B2\n(e) Plot T\u00B2/s\u00B2 vs L/cm \u{2192} straight line through origin confirms T\u00B2\u{221D}L; gradient = 4\u{03C0}\u{00B2}/g \u{2192} g = 4\u{03C0}\u{00B2}/gradient.\n(f) Ensured angle < 10\u{00B0} to maintain SHM and avoid affecting period.",
            commonMistakes: "\u{2717} Not specifying 6 exact L values\n\u{2717} Bracket notation in headings instead of solidus\n\u{2717} Plotting T vs L (gives curve, not line)\n\u{2717} Stating g = gradient instead of g = 4\u{03C0}\u{00B2}/gradient\n\u{2717} Precaution without reason",
